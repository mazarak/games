A guild may sign an an Iron Pact to create a closed trading and gaming community among Soul of Iron characters. There would be few rules:

  1. The general idea is to follow WoW's HC communities rules and ideas.
  2. All characters must join the guild when created. No gold, items or other resources, other than those on newly created characters, are allowed to brought into the guild.
  3. No auction house. Trading is done via mail or trade. Trading is only allowed within the guild.
  4. Groupping up is allowed with few restrictions:
    - If grouping for quests, all party members must be eligible for the quests you are grouping for.
    - Class quests?
    - Grouping for farming XQ or resources is okay as long as all group members gain XP from the mobs.
