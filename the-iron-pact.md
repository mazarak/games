# The Iron Pact
A guild may sign the Iron Pact to create a closed trading and gaming community among Soul of Iron characters.

## Laws of Iron:
  	1. The general idea is to follow WoW's HC community's rules and ideas as described at https://classichc.net/.
			- This is a trust-based voluntary system, its up to the guild to hold up the spirit of the HC mindset.
  	2. Only newly created characters are allowed to join. No gold, items or resources, other than those on a newly created characters, are allowed to brought into the guild.
  	3. No auction house. Trading is done via mail or trade. Trading is only allowed within the guild.
		4. Mailing is allowed within the guild.
		5. Groupping is allowed with the following restrictions:
			- Only grouping among guild members.
			- Doing quests: all party members must be eligible for the quests the group is doing.
    	- Class quests?
    	- Farming XP or resources: all party members must gain XP from the mobs.
		6. Death: if the character dies, they must be removed from the guild. Its up to the player to decide, what to do with their character after that. A RP ceremony may be held to honor the tarnished soul...
