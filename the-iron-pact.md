# The Iron Pact
A guild may sign the Iron Pact to create a closed trading and gaming community among Soul of Iron characters. Alliances between other Iron Pact guilds may be forged. The laws are extended among the allied guilds.

## Laws of Iron
1. The general idea is to follow classic WoW's HC community's rules and ideas as described at https://classichc.net/. This is a voluntary trust-based  system, and its up to the guild to hold up to the spirit of these rules.
2. Only newly created characters are allowed to join. No gold, items, or other resources, other than those on a newly created characters, are allowed to brought into the guild.
3. No auction house. Trading is allowed between the guild members. Trading is done via mail or trade. 
4. Mailing is allowed between guild members.
5. Groupping is allowed with the following restrictions:
   - Only grouping among guild members.
   - Doing quests: all party members must be eligible for the quests the group is doing.
   - Class quests?
   - Farming XP or resources: all party members must gain XP from the mobs.
6. Death: if the character dies, they must be removed from the guild. Its up to the player to decide, what they do with their character after that. A RP ceremony may be held to honor the tarnished soul...

## Why?
- To enjoy a grittier experience with more friends without sacrificing the usefulness of professions.
- To have a grittier RP experience with mortal characters to explore a survival side of the world.
