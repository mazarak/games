# A Survival Mode
I enjoy tabletop roleplay where drama and stories and created through exploration, survival, and overcoming obstacles both mundane and magical. I am exclusively playing classic WoW with my own hardcore rules variant called "The Iron Pact".

## What is the survival mode?

### The Fantasy

This mode is to be played with mortal hardcore characters, but I guess the idea could work nonetheless. In survival mode the character has to drink, eat, and rest to be able to go on. In cold environments, character has to gain warmth to not gain hypothermia. In hot areas, they need more water. You get the idea. This means the character has to carry food, drinks, campfire equipment and such with them.


### The Mechanics

#### Hungry

The character has to eat food. The amount of health the food restores difines how long the character can go on before they need to eat again. Eating foods, that give the Well Fed -buff will further increase this time based on the level of the buff. This means that the food made by the Cooking profession are supposed to be better to encourage camping if needed.

If this would be an addon or a actual feature, Hungry would be a stackable debuff, which would accumulate stacks for every x time not feeding the character. Every stack of the debuff would lower characters stats (which stats?). it would also contribute to the Exhausted debuff explained later. The character could not die from this debuff, however, to make the mechanics more robust to technical errors.

#### Thristy

Basically the sames as the Hungry but you would need a drink to get rid of this debuff (or prevent it to activate).


#### Exhausted

The character would need to get the Cozy Campfire -buff or get into a rest area to prevent getting the Exhausted debuff. The idea here is to keep the campfire incredients on character while exploring.

##### Hypothermia

This would no necessarily have to be a separate debuff, but an increase in time the Exhausted debuff would happen in cold areas (snowy conditions, e.g., Dun Morogh). In example, when exploring Dun Morogh, the charater would have to get the Cozy Campfire -buff (or get into a rest area) more ofthen than in Elwyn forest.


##### Heatstroke

In the same spirit of the Hypothermia, but in extremely hot environments (e.g., Tanaris) the character would have to drink more often. Cover from sun would be cool as well. Maybe wearing/not wearing a hat would be a thing.
