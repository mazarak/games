# A WoW Survival Mode
I enjoy tabletop roleplay where drama and stories are created through exploration, survival, and overcoming obstacles both mundane and magical. I am exclusively playing classic WoW with my own hardcore rules variant called "The Iron Pact". This is my attempt to bring more survival elements to already interesting game mode.

## What is the survival mode?

### The Fantasy

Imagine the journey the hobbits take with Aragorn from Bree to Rivendel. Not only they have their quest to accomplish, they also rest, cook by the campfire and collect herbs to heal Frodo. Imagine if some of this would be added to the WoW as well. What would the journey of the newly created character look like when they adventure in Elwyn? Or would the journey to Loch Modan feel more risky?

This mode is supposed to be played with (mortal) hardcore characters, but I guess the idea could work in regular mode as well. In survival mode the character has to drink, eat, and rest to be able to go on. In cold environments, character has to gain warmth to not gain hypothermia. In hot areas, they need more water. You get the idea. This means the character has to carry food, drinks, campfire equipment and such with them to be able explore and finish quests.

### The Mechanics

If this would be a some sort of addon or an actual feature, the following would be stackable debuffs, which would accumulate stacks for every x time the caharcter not having certain requirements met. Every stack of the debuff would lower characters stats (which stats?), make them move slower (how much?), or having some other effect (e.g., the drunken effect). The character could not die from these debuffs to make the mechanics more robust to technical errors, but continuing the adventure with them would increase to risk of dying (the harcore aspect).

#### "Hungry" debuff

The character has to eat food to not get this debuff. The amount of health the food restores defines how long the character can go on before they need to eat again. Eating foods, that give the Well Fed -buff will further increase this time based on the level of the buff. This means that the food made by the Cooking profession are supposed to be better. "Hungry" would also contribute to the Exhausted debuff explained later. 


#### "Thirsty" debuff

Basically the sames as the "Hungry" but you would need to drink to get rid of this debuff (or prevent it to activate). The amount of mana restored could define the effectivenes the same way food's restore health would work, but that doesn't make as much sense here. I would make it so that drinking Refreshing Spring Water would be as effective as Ice Cold Milk and so on.


#### "Exhausted" debuff

The character would need to rest to not get exhausted. To prevent this or get rid of the "Exhausted", the character would ned to get the Cozy Campfire -buff (from e.g., Basic Campfire) or get into a rest area. The idea here is to keep the campfire incredients on character while exploring.

Being hungry and/or thirsty will decrease the time before needing to rest again. The "death spiral" of these three debuffs would be intentional design. Continuing adventure while hungry and thirsty will wear down the character fast.


##### Hypothermia component

This wouldn't necessarily have to be a separate debuff, but an increase in time the Exhausted debuff would happen in cold areas (snowy conditions, e.g., Dun Morogh). In example, when exploring Dun Morogh, the charater would have to get the Cozy Campfire -buff (or get into a rest area) more ofthen than in Elwyn forest.


##### Heatstroke component

In the same spirit of the Hypothermia, but in extremely hot environments (e.g., Tanaris) the character would have to drink more often. Cover from sun would be cool as well. Maybe wearing/not wearing a hat would be a thing.

## Stats, spells, and talents in survival mode

Stamina and Spirit could be tied to the duration character can go on without getting the debuffs. High stamina and/or Spirit would mean longer time to get the "Exhausted". Different character abilities (spells) could have some positive effect to mitigate the negative effects. Maybe some less used talents could offer some interesting survival benefits too.

Here are some ideas:

- Frost resistance would mitigate the Hypothermia component.
- Fire resistance would mitigate the Heatsroke component.

## Useful items in survival mode

I like to idea, that the character has to have some adventuring gear with them to limit the looting capacity. Sacrificing some equipment in favor for more loot would be a calculated risk. I like that. I also like the idea, that the existing items and their properties would have some effect on the Survival mode.

Here are some ideas:

- Resistance gear could have a new use in hot/cold environments.
- Goldthorn Tea (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10841/goldthorn-tea#created-by-spell) could extend the time before needing to rest (Exhausted). Some other specific foods could have similiar effect too.
- It would be neat, if torches like the Grayson's Torch (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1172/graysons-torch#reward-from-q) would have some use.
