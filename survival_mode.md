# A WoW Survival Mode
I enjoy tabletop roleplay where drama and stories are created through exploration, survival, and overcoming obstacles both mundane and magical. I am exclusively playing classic WoW with my own hardcore rules variant called "The Iron Pact".

## What is the survival mode?

### The Fantasy

Imagine the journey the hobbits take with Aragorn from Bree to Rivendel. Not only they have their quest to accomplish, they also rest, cook by the campfire and collect herbs to heal Frodo. Imagine if some of this would be added to the WoW as well. What would the journey of the newly created character look like when they adventure in Elwyn? Or would the journey to Loch Modan feel more risky?

This mode is to be played with mortal hardcore characters, but I guess the idea could work nonetheless. In survival mode the character has to drink, eat, and rest to be able to go on. In cold environments, character has to gain warmth to not gain hypothermia. In hot areas, they need more water. You get the idea. This means the character has to carry food, drinks, campfire equipment and such with them.

### The Mechanics

If this would be an addon or an actual feature, the following would be stackable debuffs, which would accumulate stacks for every x time not having their requirements met. Every stack of the debuff would lower characters stats (which stats?), make them move slower, or having some other effect (e.g., the drunken effect). The character could not die from these debuffs to make the mechanics more robust to technical errors, but continuing the adventure with them would increase to risk of dying (the harcore aspect).

#### "Hungry" debuff

The character has to eat food to not get this debuff. The amount of health the food restores difines how long the character can go on before they need to eat again. Eating foods, that give the Well Fed -buff will further increase this time based on the level of the buff. This means that the food made by the Cooking profession are supposed to be better to encourage camping if needed. "Hungry" would also contribute to the Exhausted debuff explained later. 


#### "Thristy" debuff

Basically the sames as the "Hungry" but you would need a drink to get rid of this debuff (or prevent it to activate).


#### "Exhausted" debuff

The character would need to get the Cozy Campfire -buff or get into a rest area to prevent getting the Exhausted debuff. The idea here is to keep the campfire incredients on character while exploring. Being hungry and/or thirsty will decrease the time before needing to rest again.


##### Hypothermia component

This wouldn't necessarily have to be a separate debuff, but an increase in time the Exhausted debuff would happen in cold areas (snowy conditions, e.g., Dun Morogh). In example, when exploring Dun Morogh, the charater would have to get the Cozy Campfire -buff (or get into a rest area) more ofthen than in Elwyn forest.


##### Heatstroke component

In the same spirit of the Hypothermia, but in extremely hot environments (e.g., Tanaris) the character would have to drink more often. Cover from sun would be cool as well. Maybe wearing/not wearing a hat would be a thing.
